# Scoreboard for glow golf

##### This is the scoreboard we are using to keep track of points for glow golf. You can add as many teams/windows as you want. We typically have one window on top and one on the bottom overlayed over a video which is why there is some opacity to the boxes. Built in xcode with swift. Runs on macOS. If you are in the Dayton, OH area and would like to try glow golf visit [tennovation.app](https://www.tennovation.app)
