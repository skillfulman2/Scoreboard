#Scoreboard for glow golf.

This is the scoreboard we are using to keep track of points for glow golf. You can add as many teams/windows as you want. We typically have one window on top and one on the bottom overlayed over a video which is why there is some opacity to the boxes. Built in xcode with swift. Runs on macOS. If you are in the Dayton, OH area checkout out tennovation.app.
